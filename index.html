                    paramount. But the ability to personalize and redecorate from home is limited.<br>

                        “What steps do users take when decorating/redecorating a space and how do they feel about the process?” <br>
                        After conducting 5 interviews we noticed a similar pattern: all users pointed out common
                        blockers such as lack of time and lack of inspiration. At the same time, it was obvious that
                        working from home inclines people to redecorate for one reason or another. We also uncovered
                        that people rarely use digital tools, for example no one mentioned any of the competing interior
                        design apps, however three out of five people directly mentioned that they would love to have a
                        better way of visualizing things within the space.</p>

                    <p class="card-text lead">With user interviews completed, we went on to create the User Persona of Gene Willis, age 32, who works as
                        a Copy Editor. <br> Gene has an odd-shaped apartment which creates a lot of space constraints so
                        it is necessary to be very cautious about the size and shape of the furniture. Their work keeps them busy; its hard to find time for decorating even though they are tired of
                        looking at the same walls every day.<br>
                        Building up Gene’s personality based on the real users’ feedback helped us better understand who
                        we are designing for: <br>a busy professional who probably spends more time at home recently and
                        looking for a quick and efficient way to refresh a space.</p>

                        We observed that Gene struggled with interior decorating because of a busy schedule and lack of
                        inspiration which prevented them from even starting their project.
                        So we asked the ultimate question: <br>How might we provide
                        interior design enthusiasts with an efficient way to visualize
                        design so they can get to a final look faster based on decreased time spent defining a layout
                        and finding desired items?

                    <p class="card-text lead">We first began the prototyping process with the majority of us splitting
                        up and sketching out a portion of the user flow. These were then handed off to one person to
                        create our first low fidelity prototype by stringing them together though InVision.
                        Since the creation process was so broken up, this led to some issues of consistency and
                        ambiguity around certain features during our initial user tests which we fixed by designing our
                        wireframes with the material theme.<br>
                        For the digital prototype, we focused on onboarding, project creation options, workspace
                        features and social and collaboration options. Our onboarding process included an animated
                        splash screen as well as some coaching screens as well as a preferences quiz and an overlay for
                        the home screen explaining how to create a new project.<br>
                        There are three very in depth methods for creating a project: using a template based upon the
                        style and type of room being designed, using a camera to capture the walls of the room being
                        designed, or by manually entering in the room’s dimensions.<br>
                        Once in the workspace we are able to toggle between a 2D and 3D view of the room, add
                        furnishings to the room which additionally links to online listings for the furniture, invite
                        other users to help you design your workspace through email, and share your design with other
                        users by publishing it to the shared designs page.<br>
                        Through our next iteration of user testing we discovered that we had some dead end screens or
                        screens that couldn’t be accessed again if skipped the first time, such as the personality quiz,
                        so we added a back button and a few additional screens like the settings page. <br>
                        We also worked to bring the digital model up to high fidelity by adding pictures and copy
                        writing over old placeholders.

                <div class="card-body">
                    <p class="card-text lead">During testing we had users complete a series of tasks. We started by
                        having them navigate through the sign in experience, then we had them go through the process of
                        creating a new room layout, and lastly we had them share that room.<br>
                        During our rounds of user testing we quickly discovered a few huge design oversights.<br>
                        The first was the navigation. Some users found the initial navigation to be a bit confusing as
                        the home and shared page looked the same as well as the bottom nav bar always being the same
                        color no matter what page you were on. We fixed this by having it change color depending upon
                        what page you’re on to more clearly show the user where they were. We also opted to add a label
                        to the create a room button to reduce confusion with the purpose of the FAB.

                    <p class="card-text lead"> Secondly, users found our use of the heart icon confusing. <br> Most
                        users
                        associated hearts with liking or favoriting things, not as a share button. <br> We fixed this by
                        changing out the heart for the more standardized share icon.</p>
